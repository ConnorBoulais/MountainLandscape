Mountain Landscape Procedural Generation Simulator
===========================

This project is a procedurally generated world, where the user can change procedural factors (frequency, amplitude, and octaves) in real time using the keyboard.

The world is a mountain landscape, with grass, trees, cliffs, and an interactable sun.
